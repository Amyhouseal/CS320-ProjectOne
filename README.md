How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- I ensure my code or program is secure by confirming that my code includes input validation, error handling, logging, output encoding, access control, encryption and hashing. To ensure it's functionality, I confirm that my code performs the process it was built for and error handles accordingly. I also ensure that my code is neat and comprehensive and includes comments for future developers to understand it's process.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- When interpreting user needs I lean into the waterfall method to help project the needs of the program. For more complicated programs I will utilize an agile approach when testing, planning and integration.

How do I approach designing software?
- When designing software I take a top down approach. Have a high-level understanding of the system & break it's components down into smaller goals.
